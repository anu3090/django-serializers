# Django Serializers

**Customizable Serialization for Django.**

**Author:** Tom Christie, [Follow me on Twitter][1].

## Overview

`django-serializers` gives you a declarative serialization and deserialization API, that mirrors Django's `Form`/`ModelForm` API.  It provides flexible serialization and deserialization of objects, models and querysets, and is intended to be a potential replacement for Django's current  fixture serialization.

Features:

* Arbitrary objects can be serialized using the `Serializer` class.
* Models and querysets can be serialized using the `ModelSerializer` class.
* Supports backwards compatible fixture serialization, using the `FixtureSerializer` class.
* Supports flat or nested serialization, and handles depth and recursive relationships.
* Currently supports 'json', 'yaml', 'xml', 'csv'.
* Relationships can be serialized to primary keys, natural keys, or custom implementations.
* Comprehensive test suite.
* Passes Django's existing serialization test suite.

For an example of using `django-serializers` to create Web APIs,
please see [django-auto-api][2].

# Requirements

Currently requires Django >= 1.4

# Installation

Install using pip:

    pip install django-serializers

Optionally, if you want to include the `django-serializer` tests in your
project, add `serializers` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'serializers',
    )

Note that if you have cloned the git repo you can run the tests directly, with
the provided `manage.py` file:

    manage.py test

# Working with Serializers

## Serializing objects

Let's start by creating a simple object we can use for example purposes:

    class Comment(object):
        def __init__(self, title, content, created=None):
            self.title = title
            self.content = content
            self.created = created or datetime.datetime.now()
    
    comment = Comment(title='blah', content='foo bar baz')

We'll declare a serializer that we can use to serialize and deserialize `Comment` objects.
Declaring a serializer looks very similar to declaring a form:

    class CommentSerializer(Serializer):
        title = CharField()
        content = CharField()
        created = DateTimeField(label='created time')

We can now use `CommentSerializer` to serialize a comment, or list of comments, into `json`, `yaml`, `xml` or `csv` formats:

    >>> serializer = CommentSerializer()
    >>> stream = serializer.serialize('json', comment, indent=4)
    >>> print stream
    {
        "title": "blah", 
        "content": "foo bar baz", 
        "created time": "2012-07-12T09:01:14.302"
    }

## Deserializing objects

We can deserialize encoded data, using the same serializer class: 

    >>> serializer.deserialize('json', stream)
    {'content': u'foo bar baz', 'created': datetime.datetime(2012, 7, 12, 9, 1, 14, 302000), 'title': u'blah'}
    
Note that when we deserialized the stream, we ended up with a dictionary containing the correct fields, but we haven't got a fully deserialized `Comment` instance.  

That's because the `CommentSerializer` doesn't yet have any way of determining what class it should deserialize objects into, or how those objects should be instantiated.

We can explicitly control how the deserialized objects are instantiated by defining the `revert_object` method:

    class CommentSerializer(Serializer):
        title = CharField()
        content = CharField()
        created = DateTimeField(label='created time')
       
        def revert_object(self, cls, attrs):
            return Comment(**attrs)

Declaring the `revert_object` method is optional, and may not be required if you don't need to support deserialization.

**Note: When working with the base Serializer class, the `cls` argument to `revert_object` is not used, and will always be `None`.  When working with `ModelSerializer` or `FixtureSerializer`, the `cls` argument will be set to the class of the model being serialized or deserialized.**

## Validation

Deserializing the data also applies validation, in much the same way as occurs when using Forms.
If validation fails, a `ValidationError` will be raised.

**TODO: Describe validation in more depth**

## Dealing with nested objects

The previous example is fine for dealing with objects that only have simple datatypes, but sometimes we also need to be able to represent more complex objects,
where some of the attributes of an object might not be simple datatypes such as strings, dates or integers.

The `Serializer` class is itself a type of `Field`, and can be used to represent relationships where one object type is nested inside another.

    class UserSerializer(Serializer):
        email = EmailField()
        username = CharField()
        
        def revert_object(cls, attrs):
            return User(**attrs)


    class CommentSerializer(Serializer):
        user = UserSerializer()
        title = CharField()
        content = CharField()
        created = DateTimeField(label='created time')
        
        def revert_object(self, cls, attrs):
            return Comment(**attrs)

## Creating custom fields

If you want to create a custom field, you'll probably want to override either one or both of the `.to_native()` and `.from_native()` methods.  These two methods are used to convert between the intial datatype, and a primative, serializable datatype.  Primative datatypes may be any of a number, string, date/time/datetime or None.  They may also be any list or dictionary like object that only contains other primative objects.

The `.to_native()` method is called to convert the initial datatype into a primative, serializable datatype.  The `from_native()` method is called to restore a primative datatype into it's initial representation.

Let's look at an example of serializing a class that represents an RGB color value:

    class Color(object):
        """
        A color represented in the RGB colorspace.
        """

        def __init__(self, red, green, blue):
            assert(red >= 0 and green >= 0 and blue >= 0)
            assert(red < 256 and green < 256 and blue < 256)
            self.red, self.green, self.blue = red, green, blue

    class ColourField(Field):
        """
        Color objects are serialized into "rgb(#, #, #)" notation.
        """

        def to_native(self, obj):
            return "rgb(%d, %d, %d)" % (obj.red, obj.green, obj.blue)
      
        def from_native(self, data):
            data = data.strip('rgb(').rstrip(')')
            red, green, blue = [int(col) for col in data.split(',')]
            return Color(red, green, blue)
            

By default field values are treated as mapping to an attribute on the object.  If you need to customize how the field value is accessed and set you need to override `.field_to_native()` and/or `.field_from_native()`.

As an example, let's create a field that can be used represent the class name of the object being serialized:

    class ClassNameField(Field):
        def field_to_native(self, obj, field_name):
            """
            Serialize the object's class name, not an attribute of the object.
            """
            return obj.__class__.__name__

        def field_from_native(self, data, field_name, into):
            """
            We don't want to set anything when we revert this field.
            """
            pass

# Working with ModelSerializers

Typically the serializer classes will map closely to the model

    class AccountSerializer(ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Account

* `Model` can also be set on `init`

## Specifying fields explicitly 

    class AccountSerializer(ModelSerializer):
        get_absolute_url = Field(field_name='url')
        group = NaturalKeyField()

        class Meta:
            model = Account

* Mention properties.
* May be callables

## Relational fields

* Can be used for relationships & reverse relationships
* PrimaryKeyField, NaturalKeyField
* Sublclassing RelatedField.

## Specifying which fields should be included

* fields
* exclude
* May also be set in `serialize()`

## Specifiying nested serialization

* nested = `True`|`False`|`<int>`
* May also be set in `serialize()`

## Customising the default fields used by a ModelSerializer

    class AccountSerializer(ModelSerializer):
        class Meta:
            model = Account

        def get_nested_field(self, model_field):
            return ModelSerializer()

        def get_related_field(self, model_field):                
            return NaturalKeyField()

        def get_field(self, model_field):
            return Field()

#Â Customizing encoding formats

Out of the box `django-serializers` supports `json`, `yaml`, `xml` and `csv` formats.  You can support other formats, or modify the existing formats, by writing custom renderer and parser classes.

## Renderers

* Explain that input is native python datatypes.
* Same as output of `.serialize('python', objects)`
* Give HTML table example

## Parsers


## Providing additional metadata

* Sometimes need to be able to get at the Field instance used for each field.
* format-specific metadata.
* XML `attributes`, other examples: For HTML Field might have `template` or `widget`.

# Creating custom Serializer types

Describe how to write totally custom serializer classes, that determine their fields automatically based on the object being serialized, or the data being deserialized.

Give an example, using an `ObjectSerializer` class, that serializes all the instance attributes on an object. 

* `.default_fields(self, obj, cls, nested)`
* `.determine_class(self, data)`

---
